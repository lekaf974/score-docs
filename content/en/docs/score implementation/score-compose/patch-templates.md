Since `score-compose` version [`0.27.0`](https://github.com/score-spec/score-compose/releases/tag/0.27.0), as Platform Engineers you can override or patch the default Workload manifests generated by `score-compose generate`. Seemlessly for your Developers, by using `score-compose init --patch-templates`.

Each template file is evaluated as a Golang text/template and should output a yaml/json encoded array of patches. Each patch is an object with required `op` (`set` or `delete`), `patch` (a dot-separated json path), a `value` if the `op` == `set`, and an optional `description` for showing in the logs.

For example, to inject more security for each Workload you can use this template [`score-compose/unprivileged.tpl`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/score-spec/community-patchers/refs/heads/main/score-compose/unprivileged.tpl):

```yaml
{{ range $name, $spec := .Workloads }}
{{ range $cname, $_ := $spec.containers }}
- op: set
  path: services.{{ $name }}-{{ $cname }}.read_only
  value: true
- op: set
  path: services.{{ $name }}-{{ $cname }}.user
  value: "65532"
- op: set
  path: services.{{ $name }}-{{ $cname }}.cap_drop
  value: ["ALL"]
{{ end }}
{{ end }}
```

You can run this command to use this patch template:

```bash
score-compose init --patch-templates https://raw.githubusercontent.com/score-spec/community-patchers/refs/heads/main/score-compose/unprivileged.tpl
```

And then the `generate` command will use it for the generated `compose.yaml` file:

```bash
score-compose generate score.yaml
```

A list of patch templates shared by the community can be found [here](https://github.com/score-spec/community-patchers). Users are encouraged to use them and contribute to this growing list of patch templates.
